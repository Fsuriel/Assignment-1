 <p>Since the Marihuana Regulation & Taxation Act legalized the sell, use, and possession of marijuana in 2021, there are a total of ten licensed dispensaries in New York City. But the process to normalize marijuana isn’t free of problems. Subsequently while many applicants wait for a license, others set up dispensaries tied to loopholes around weed policy. Granny Za is a dispensay located on Orchard street in the Lower East.</p>

<h2>Lower East Side</h2>
<p> The lower East Side(LES) has become a hot spot for pot shops. There are few licensed marijuana dispensaries open in New York City however, the number of places that deal marijuana are hard to estimate. It is difficult to estimate how many dispensaries are active because not all shops are categorized as dispensaries. Most shops operate as artwork shops or clothing shops. The premise is they sell people a product with complimentary weed as a gift.</p>

<h2>Positive Effects</h2>
<p> One of the positives to the recent surge in marijuana shops is that it is convinient for thos trying to get marijuana. The rise of shops like MOZ, derived from the purpose to of educating younger generations about marijuana, reducing the negative stigma around it.</p>

<h2>Negative Effects</h2>
<p>New York State policy still prohibits the sale of marijuana sold without a license. Governor Kathy Hochuls aggresive approach on marijuana enforcement has led to the confiscation of more than 8,500 Pounds of illegal product at an estimated value of more than $40 Million.</p>
